- 👋 Hi, I’m Chang Sun
- 👀 I’m interested in ML MOEA and their applications in engineering
- 🌱 I’m currently learning interpretable of ML, multi-paradigm driven method and casual inference
- 💞️ I’m looking to research in multi-paradigm driven prediction and optimisation
- 📫 How to reach me: sunchang.eng@gamil.com
- ✨ Here I will provide the source codes and data of my accepted works for review and reproduction. Also I will provide my batch simulation method and relative post-pocessing extraction codes for dataset construction. Most of my codes are based on MATLAB, while Python is also involved.
